# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning
> This project implements the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame, with an optional Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to learn and play the game autonomously. The game environment is structured to resemble a Gym-like interface for seamless RL integration.

## Features
- Classic Snake Gameplay: Play the game using keyboard controls (Arrow Keys).
- AI Training Environment: Train an AI agent to master the game using RL techniques like Deep Q-Learning.
- Dynamic Rewards System:
- Positive reward for eating food.
- Negative reward for collisions or hitting walls.
- Customizable Settings: Modify the snake's speed, game dimensions, and other parameters.
